## Description

[`slapnap`](https://github.com/benkeser) is a Docker image for 
developing cross-validation-based ensemble predictors of neutralization 
sensitivity/resistance using HIV
sequences from the [CATNAP database](http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). The
image provides an automated tool for reading the data from the online
database, compiling analytic data sets, developing prediction models,
and summarizing results. 

This repository contains supplemental code related to the manuscript. 

* `multiple_sensitivity/` contains code used to validate `slapnap` for usage with multiple antibody combinations. See the directory's `README` for more information.
