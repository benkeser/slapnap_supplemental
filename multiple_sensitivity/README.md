## Description

This directory contains all code needed to reproduce the `slapnap` analysis of multiple antibody regimens. The dependency structure of the code can be examined by studying the `Makefile`. See `make help` for more details on the components of the analysis.

The code requires the following installed software:
* `make`
* `docker`
* `R` (with `Rscript` executable in `PATH`)
* `R` packages: `here`, `SuperLearner`, `cvAUC`, `ggplot2`

With this software is installed, the analysis can be reproduced by executing `make auc_fig` or simply `make` at the command line. However, do note that this will simultaneously run 32 Docker containers to obtain results. Consequently, you may need to increase the available memory available to your Docker program and/or ensure that you are on a computer that has adequate resources for executing this task.

## Details

The analysis is executed in several stages. First `slapnap_output` is made by running the `slapnap` container for each of 16 combination antibodies. For each antibody, two containers are run: one to trainer the learner based on the individual antibody data, the second to obtain a data set for the combination antibody. These results are saved in `bash_output/` in folders with the name of each antibody separated by underscores and a `_2` to denote the folder where data for the combination antibody is saved. 

Next, `R_output/all_nabs.txt` is created, which simply formats the antibody names to be used in later `R` scripts. 

Next, `R_output/rslt_df.RData` is created, by executing `R/combine_results.R`. Note that this execution occurs *inside* the slapnap container, to ensure that there are no compiler errors associated with using `slapnap`-trained learners to predict on features. 

Next, `R_output/n_sens_df.RData` is created, by executing `R/describe_combo_sens.R`. The file contains information on the number of resistant sequences for each measured combination antibody regimen. 

Finally, all results are pieced together by executing `R/make_auc_fig.R` (locally) with output being an image saved in `fig/auc_fig.tiff`.
