## Description

This directory contains all code needed to reproduce the `slapnap` test-set analyses of 3BNC117 + 10-1074.

The code requires the following installed software:
* `docker`
* `R` (with `Rscript` executable in `PATH`)
* `R` packages: `here`, `SuperLearner`, `cvAUC`, `dplyr`, `tibble`, `ggplot2`, `cowplot`

With this software is installed, the analysis can be reproduced by:

1. Executing `bash chmod u+x bash/run_docker_containers.sh` from the command line;
2. Executing `bash bash/run_docker_containers.sh` and waiting for the results to finish (this may take a while);
3. Executing ;
4.

## Details

The analysis is executed in several stages. First the `slapnap` container is run for the combination of antibodies 10-1074 and 3BNC117. The results are saved in `bash_output/` in a folder with the name of this antibody combination.

Next, `R_output/all_nabs.txt` is created, which simply formats the antibody names to be used in later `R` scripts.

Next, `R_output/rslt_df.RData` is created, by executing `R/combine_results.R`. Note that this execution occurs *inside* the slapnap container, to ensure that there are no compiler errors associated with using `slapnap`-trained learners to predict on features.

Finally, all results are pieced together by executing `R/make_auc_fig.R` (locally) with output being an image saved in `fig/auc_fig.tiff`.
